Data Summary
We have 9717 data entries.
I removed the house types: commercial, hotel, and restauration because there were only a few entries for each.
Also changed the price limit to 750000 because again we only had a few entries above that amount, not enough to generalize.
If we remove the data, there are only 2289 entries left. 
I made a histogram plotting the amount of missing data for each of the following features. num_bed: 1492, year_built: 1944, living_area: 3531, num_rooom: 5276, num_bath: 276

Evaluation Criteria and Cross Validation
Since depending on the method used to remove missing data, we will have different sized dataset containing a different distribution of house prices, MSE is not a good criteria because we will not be able to compare it across datasets. Instead we use percent improvement which is calculated by creating a predictor that just guesses the mean of the training data and measuring its error (mean absolute error), call this Err_random. %improvement = (Err_random-Err_test)/Err_random. Does this make sense to use?
Cross validation is done 5-fold with 80% of the data. 20% of the data is set aside for testing. In the case where we remove entries with missing data, this means there are 458 test examples. When we keep the missing data, there are 1943 test entries.
